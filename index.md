### My life
I was born in 2004. I wasnt the smartest kid out there infact I was in special classess where they went slower for basically my enitre schooling carerr. That was until I reached 11th grade where the summer before that I took a geomtry class over the summer and got into the algebra 2 the normal classess that students would take. In addition to that I also go to two different schools each day one being peters township and the second being WACTC aka Western Area Career Technology Center. Peters Township High school is your average high school while WACTC is school where you learn professions like cullenary, machining, Health assistance, etc. The class I take is the Networking class which by the name its about computers, how to build, maintain computers but also networks.
